As part of the <a href="http://kavlilectures.adlerplanetarium.org/" target="_blank">Adler Planetarium's Kavli Fulldome Lecture Series</a>, we developed an online interactive viewer for exoplanets.  This particular interactive accompanied Dr. Lisa Kaltenegger's lecture: *Are We Alone in the Universe?*. In this interactive, you can explore real data from the Open Exoplanet Catalogue, and fly around the Galaxy to learn about when and how these exoplanets were discovered and view their architectures.

A live version of this repo is available <a target="_blank" href="https://ageller.github.io/Kavli_WebGL_exoplanets/"> here. </a>
